# Threading and serialized API access

This document describes the internal threading design. Application authors
should use the public rules in
[Windows programming](../guides/windows.md#threads-and-api-ownership).

## Compatibility requirements

The public API has one process-wide [`od_control`](../reference/control/index.md)
object and one active door session. OpenDoors does not serialize application
access or impose thread affinity. An application using multiple threads must
serialize every public function, public global, and returned public pointer.
The implementation must retain the `tODControl` layout and established calling
conventions, including support for legacy Win32 and 16-bit DOS targets.

## Thread roles

All platforms use the same cooperative kernel flow. The active application flow polls
communications, detects carrier loss, interprets input, updates time and
status, runs chat mode, mutates terminal state, invokes callbacks, and
performs initialization and shutdown.

Windows retains one library UI thread. It owns the top-level window, screen
child, and their message queue; converts operator commands to pending
application operations; and paints published screen generations. Startup and
shutdown use events and a cooperative message-loop stop followed by a join.

`OD_THREAD_SUPPORT` is an internal build macro selecting the thread primitives
needed by the Windows UI. It does not select a separate kernel implementation.

## Synchronization domains

The serialized application flow is the sole accessor of
[`od_control`](../reference/control/index.md). The Windows UI reads a cache
containing only its required fields. At an outer API entry, exit, or blocking
checkpoint, the active application flow drains the pending UI FIFO into
[`od_control`](../reference/control/index.md) in order and then refreshes that
cache. The cache and FIFO head and tail are protected by the kernel-state
mutex.

Windows screen state has two complete buffers. The application flow mutates the
application buffer and records one dirty bit. At outer API exit, or before a
blocking checkpoint, it exchanges buffers under the presentation mutex and
invalidates the screen child. `WM_PAINT` holds only that mutex while reading an
immutable display generation.

The input queue mutex protects its indices, event storage, last-activity time,
and last list-control key. Its semaphore counts available events.
Communications serialization remains inside the communications module.

## Owner dispatch and callbacks

Frame requests are nodes in an ordered linked FIFO: chat, keyboard,
sysop-next, inactivity, time-limit, lockout, or shutdown. Dispatch detaches the
FIFO under the kernel-state mutex, then applies and frees nodes without holding
the mutex. Requests are neither coalesced nor reordered.

Time processing and normal application callbacks run synchronously in the
active application flow. Windows help and configuration callbacks retain their established
frame-thread context. They block the frame message loop while running and must
not access any OpenDoors API, ABI object, or returned pointer. They may notify
application-owned synchronization or queue work for a serialized API caller.

No callback runs while the kernel-state or input-queue mutex is held.

## Blocking calls and shutdown

Blocking input and modem waits use short bounded waits. The application flow temporarily
drops its API nesting level, waits, restores that level, dispatches pending UI
work, and runs the cooperative kernel. Caller serialization remains held for
the complete public call. Process creation uses the same nesting
release and restore around child execution.

[`od_exit()`](../reference/api/od_exit.md) stops and joins the Windows UI before
destroying the UI FIFO mutex, input queue, communications object, or virtual
screen.

## Review checklist

1. Cooperative work stays in the shared application flow.
2. Cross-thread UI work is represented as data and dispatched at API boundaries.
3. The UI thread never invokes application-flow API or ordinary callbacks.
4. No kernel-state or input-queue mutex is held while waiting, painting,
   communicating, joining a thread, or invoking application code.
5. New platform-guarded code remains compilable by every applicable legacy
   toolchain.
