# Public integration acceptance tests

These tests are downstream consumers of the installed OpenDoors package. They
include only `OpenDoor.h` and `ODStat.h`; implementation headers and private
test hooks are deliberately unavailable.

`public-contract.json` inventories every public function, global, type,
constant, compatibility alias, personality helper, and `tODControl` field. Run
the checker after changing either public header:

```sh
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 tools/check_public_contract.py
```

`generate_public_contract.py` prints a replacement manifest for review. It
does not modify the tree. Coverage assignments should be reviewed along with
the implementation and reference documentation rather than accepted merely
because they were generated.

To exercise an installed shared package, use:

```sh
cmake -S tests/acceptance -B build/acceptance \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/opendoors \
  -DOPENDOORS_VARIANT=Shared \
  -DOPENDOORS_ACCEPTANCE_EXTENDED=ON
cmake --build build/acceptance
ctest --test-dir build/acceptance --output-on-failure
```

When cross-running Windows integration and regression binaries through Wine,
use `tools/wine-ctest` instead of invoking CTest directly. The runner creates
a private Xvfb display and temporarily configures Wine's crash debugger to
write noninteractive minidumps. Every new dump is moved to the requested
artifact directory under a unique name, analyzed with WineDbg, and reported
on standard error before the original crash-handler setting is restored.

```sh
tools/wine-ctest --display :91 \
  --wine /usr/local/bin/wine64.bin --prefix "$HOME/.wine" \
  --artifacts build/wine64/crashes \
  --test-dir build/wine64 --output-on-failure
```

On FreeBSD, run 32-bit tests through the packaged `/usr/local/bin/wine`
wrapper and set `WINE_i386_ROOT` when the i386 package tree is not in its
default location. Do not point the test emulator directly at the i386
`wine.bin`: the wrapper supplies the library mappings needed when a tested
program creates another Windows process.

```sh
WINE_i386_ROOT="$HOME/.i386-wine-pkg" \
tools/wine-ctest --display :92 \
  --wine /usr/local/bin/wine --prefix "$HOME/.wine" \
  --artifacts build/wine32/crashes \
  --test-dir build/wine32 --output-on-failure
```

The ordinary smoke-integration suite contains deterministic compile, ABI,
lifecycle, screen, configuration, spawn, and drop-file scenarios. The extended
setting adds seven transport-neutral public-API scenarios for input, interactive
prompts, formatted and multiline editing, display and files, terminal
emulation, `FILES.BBS` listings, and connection/session behavior. Unix runs them
over an inherited socket, Windows uses loopback TCP, and the DOS build reuses
the same protocol over direct UART and FOSSIL serial paths. Every enabled
transport must satisfy the same scenario assertions; only endpoint setup and
the selected `od_com_method` differ.

GitHub Actions runs the ordinary cases on pushes and pull requests. The
extended matrix runs nightly when the default branch has advanced since the
last successful scheduled run, or unconditionally on request, and is required
for releases. Its DOS jobs run all seven scenarios through DOSBox over 16-bit
direct UART and over both direct UART and FOSSIL with DOS/4GW and DOS/32A. The
extended workflow also publishes a single Clang/Unix branch-coverage report.
That report is directional and has no percentage or delta gate; Windows and
DOS runtime results remain authoritative for their platform-specific paths.

Interactions which would need private mocks are recorded separately in
[`../COMPONENT_TEST_BACKLOG.md`](../COMPONENT_TEST_BACKLOG.md). Acceptance
tests must not add production hooks or substitutes to reach those branches.

On Windows, `acceptance.windows_screen` also creates the real local frame and
screen child, forces a published generation through `WM_PAINT`, and injects a
local key while the application waits in `od_get_input()`. The helper uses only
Win32 window operations. `acceptance.windows_thread_handoff` verifies that an
application lock can serialize API calls and shutdown across different caller
threads.

Acceptance expectations describe the behavior of the current implementation.
Problems exposed while characterizing that behavior are recorded in
[`ISSUES.md`](../../ISSUES.md); the test suite does not introduce an unreviewed behavior change to
make a preferred expectation pass.
